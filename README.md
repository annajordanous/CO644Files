# COMP6440Files
This is a repository for files I use in teaching COMP6440 Semantic Web at University of Kent.
The majority are files that I have acquired from online sources.

The dataset for Assessment 2 is available to access (and download/inspect) via this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annajordanous/CO644Files/main/export_kar_RDFN3.n3 
Alternative URI for the Assessment 2 data (if needed) https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/akj22/materials/CO644/export_kar_RDFN3.n3 

To query this data using SPARQL, use the above dataset link as the Target graph URI in the SPARQL endpoint public processor service: http://sparql.org/sparql.html   (as you have been doing in the classes). Don’t forget to set output to ‘Text’, to make it easier to copy and paste the answers from the endpoint to your answer document file.

Alternative public endpoint: https://demo.openlinksw.com/sparql/ (in the 'Sponging' drop down menu under the text entry box, select the option 'Retrieve Remote RDF data for all missing source graphs'  the first time you run a query in this endpoint.
